This code performs two main tasks: K-Means clustering and Logistic Regression classification. First, it clusters users based on their watch_time_hour, avg_rating_given, and genre preferences using K-Means, followed by visualizing the cluster centroids and evaluating the clustering quality with a Silhouette Score. Then, it classifies users into genre categories using logistic regression, training the model on watch_time_hour and avg_rating_given, and evaluates the performance through a confusion matrix and classification report. The goal is to analyze user behavior and genre preferences, providing insights into their viewing patterns and predictive accuracy.
